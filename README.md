Hi, I'm Mikey! üëã

I'm a senior developer, technical coach, artist, facilitator, and community organizer.

I host group spaces to empower others, not only in a technical or strategic sense, but also a cultural or caring sense. I prioritize the well-being of my community (and myself), which feeds into the strength of my projects.

I've undergone a wide arc of experiments in reinventing wheels, from playing with new technology stacks to playing with social business structures to playing with cultural memes, I have a deep understanding of _how things work_, I've made enough mistakes to learn how to _choose my battles_.

I now want to use my skills to lead teams in delivering tangible value.

## Skills

- practiced in circumspect group facilitation, from everyday meetings to project retrospectives to community engagement to long-term company retreats
- proficient with JavaScript, Rust, Ruby (on Rails), Python, Clojure, and C
- performant in using decentralized platforms (Scuttlebutt, Dat, IPFS, Bitcoin) and web technologies (React, Angular, HTML & CSS) to quickly create accessible, responsive, and magical user-centric apps
- skilled in using Linux systems for every occasion, from personal use to adminstration, from scaling infrastructure (Docker Swarm or Kubernetes or Salt Stack) to managing a system (Debian, Bash, Systemd)

> I feel very lucky to have worked with Mikey on the Minded Web App. His enthusiasm for code is infectious. His ability and willingness to tackle hard problems amazed me. Mikey was a very supportive and patient mentor. He pushed me to solve problems at the edges of my comfort zone with kindness and was enthusiastic about walking me through problems I struggled with. He is also a wonderful human to work with, who will always prioritize people care before solving technical problems, creating a productive and enjoyable work environment.

### [Richard D. Bartlett](http://richdecibels.com/)

> [Mikey, you have] impeccable vibe hygiene. This means you pay close attention to how bodies feel in space and I've only ever seen you act in ways that improve the quality of that feeling. It means I know you'll keep an eye and ear on the lighting and acoustics of a room. I trust you would intervene graciously if some brute were disturbing the convivial atmosphere at a party. I trust you to look after me when [in a vulnerable situation].
