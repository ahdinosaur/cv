> [Mikey, you have] impeccable vibe hygiene. This means you pay close attention to how bodies feel in space and I've only ever seen you act in ways that improve the quality of that feeling. It means I know you'll keep an eye and ear on the lighting and acoustics of a room. I trust you would intervene graciously if some brute were disturbing the convivial atmosphere at a party. I trust you to look after me when [in a vulnerable situation].
